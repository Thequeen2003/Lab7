I, Alantis Green, pledge that I have neither given nor received unauthorized help on this lab as explained in
the course syllabus and on the first day of class. Aside from the help of a TA or Professor, I have not used
outside sources including but not limited to the work or help of previous students, current students or
the internet. Each assignment is entirely the work of my own and I understand the academic integrity as
documented by the honor code of Wake Forest University‚Äù.
